## 4. Initialising Dendron

Congrats, we now have our repository ready. But wait, we aren't seeing the Dendron Vault yet...

First, open the command palette. You can do this by pressing on Mac: `‚åò` + `Shift` + `P` or on Windows: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P`

Now in the Command Palette, type `Dendron: Change Workspace` and press `Enter` on your keyboard.


You will be prompted to enter the new path for Dendron. The easiest way to do this is to **Right click** the **empty space** in the left hand column, in the dropdown titled **ANIMALS-AS-OBJECTS** and click **Copy Path.**

Then **paste** this path into the Command Palette by hitting `Ctrl + P` (windows) or `‚åò + P` (mac), and then hit `Enter`

Congratulations! The entire workflow should now be setup.  üéâ ü¶ç üï∂Ô∏è
