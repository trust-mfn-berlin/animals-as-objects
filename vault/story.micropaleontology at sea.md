As the global conflicts of the first half of the 20th century only increased society's thirst for fossil fuels, industrial micropaleontology continued its rise to fame. But, at least until the end of the second Wold War, the efforts of micropaleontologists had concentrated almost exclusively on foraminifera, and the understanding of earth's complex dynamics was still taking shape. As oil became more profitable, a better knowledge of global stratigraphy was increasingly necessary. In this context, the work of [[material.william rex riedel]], and his reassessment of [[material.radiolaria]] species ranges, represented a pivotal point in the histoy of micropaleontology - and opened new questions and research avenues. Encouraged by his supervisor, as a graduate student Riedel started focusing on this group, which had largely been neglected since the end of the 19th century. Analysing more closely the material studied by [[material.ernst haeckel]] from the [[material.hms challenger]] expedition, Riedel noticed that the German naturalist often didn't correctly discriminate between older fossils and more recent materials. Rather than presenting long ranging forms, he realized that radiolarian species could also be used in [[material.biostratigraphy]], since their species ranges, like those of [[material.foraminifera]], offer helpful tools to interpret geological formations and their relations as they do change considerably over relatively short geological times. After the earlier, less successful, experience of micropaleontology at sea, which by the end of the 19th century had lead scientists to overlook the importance of microfossils, micropaleontologists were to become once again deeply involved with [[story.oceanography]]. 

This was especially facilitated by the introduction of the [[material.piston corer]], a tool that allowed to collect cores up to 9 meters long from the deep ocean floor. Studying the first such cores collected by the [[material.albatross expedition]] during his visit to Sweden in 1950, Riedel became aware of the value of these samples for micropaleontology. As he moved to California the following year, he brought this insight with him to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, placing micropaleontology at the forefront of postwar oceanography. As Riedel and others quickly understood, the stratigraphy of the ocean floor held an impressive and important record useful not only to the extractive industries, but also, increasingly, to better understand the history and dynamics of the planet. This was especially true since novel techniques emerging from wartime developments in [[material.nuclear physics]] spread to other fields, as exemplified well by the contributions of [[material.cesare emiliani]]. In the 1950s, Emiliani was working at the Enrico Fermi Institute for Nuclear Science, as a research associate in the geochemical laboratory of [[material.harold urey]] - who was pioneering the study of the relationships between stable [[material.isotopes]] and environmental variables. Applying these insights to [[material.foraminifera]], Emiliani was able to relate changes in oxygen isotopes contained within microfossils with changes in ocean temperatures: the microfossil record accumulated on the bottom of the sea, he demonstrated, could work as a [[material.paleothermometer]], since it registered environmental changes within the microorganisms' biochemistry which in turn signaled changes in temperatures.

As these novel insights showed, ocean sediments promised to provide vast and useful data, and shed light on the deeper and less visible processes shaping our planet - especially thanks to microfossils. The vast apparatus required to collect these samples and data was made available thanks to a broader epochal change in the landscape of the technosciences set off by wartime research, and propelled further by postwar geopolitics: the advent of [[material.big science]]. With its characteristic large involvement of national and military funding, allowing for bigger budgets, teams, labs, and instruments, big science boosted micropaleontology and its connection with oceanography through the development of [[material.deep sea drilling]]. Championed by [[material.william rex riedel]], [[material.cesare emiliani]], and many other scientists, the effort to explore and document the global oceans, and especially their stratigraphy, was to engender a number of research projects that continue to this day through the [[material.JOIDES]] cooperation, and that revolutionized the understanding of the planet's dynamics. Thanks to these technological and conceptual transformations, industrial micropaleontology consolidated its importance not only as an applied aspect of the extractive industries, but also - increasingly - as a foundational tool in the study of the planet's dynamics and deep history. As the examples of both Riedel and Emiliani illustrate, this novel role of micropaleontology was especially and increasingly associated with [[story.oceanography]] and its deepening connection with [[material.system sciences]], which were part of a deeper transformation and adjustment of the landscape of scientific knowledge production.
