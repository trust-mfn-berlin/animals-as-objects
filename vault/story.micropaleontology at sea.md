The global conflicts of the first half of the 20th century only increased society's thirst for fossil fuels, and so industrial micropaleontology continued its rise to fame. Until the end of the second World War, the efforts of micropaleontologists had concentrated almost exclusively on [[material.foraminifera]]. As oil became more profitable, requiring an even better knowledge of global stratigraphy, a new understanding of earth's complex dynamics was taking shape. In this context, [[material.william rex riedel]]'s reassessment of [[material.radiolaria]] species ranges not only represented a pivotal point in the histoy of micropaleontology, but also opened new questions and research avenues. As a graduate student, Riedel had started focusing on this group, which had largely been neglected since the end of the 19th century. Analysing more closely the material studied by [[material.ernst haeckel]] from the [[material.hms challenger]] expedition, Riedel noticed that the German naturalist often didn't correctly discriminate between older fossils and more recent materials. Rather than presenting long ranging forms, he realized that radiolarian species could also be used in [[material.biostratigraphy]], since their species ranges, like those of foraminifera, offer helpful tools to interpret geological formations and their relations as they do change considerably over relatively short geological times. After the earlier, less successful, experience of micropaleontology at sea, which by the end of the 19th century had led scientists to overlook the importance of microfossils, micropaleontologists were to become once again deeply involved with [[story.oceanography]]. 

The introduction of the [[material.piston corer]], a tool that allowed the collection of cores up to 9 meters long from the deep ocean floor, was particularly instrumental in micropaleontology's return to the sea. Studying the first such cores collected by the [[material.albatross expedition]] during his visit to Sweden in 1950, Riedel became aware of the value of these samples for micropaleontology. As he moved to California the following year, he brought this insight with him to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography [^2], placing micropaleontology at the forefront of postwar oceanography. As Riedel and others quickly understood, the stratigraphy of the ocean floor held an impressive and important record useful not only to the extractive industries, but also, increasingly, to an understanding of the planet's dynamic history. In a complementary development, novel techniques emerging from wartime developments in [[material.nuclear physics]] supported and transformed knowledge production in other fields, as exemplified well by the contributions of [[material.cesare emiliani]]. In the 1950s, Emiliani was working at the Enrico Fermi Institute for Nuclear Science, as a research associate in the geochemical laboratory of [[material.harold urey]] - who was pioneering the study of the relationships between stable [[material.isotopes]] and environmental variables. Applying these insights to [[material.foraminifera]], Emiliani was able to relate changes in oxygen isotopes contained within microfossils with changes in ocean temperatures: he demonstrated that the microfossil record that had accumulated on the bottom of the sea could work as a [[material.paleothermometer]]. It registered environmental changes within the microorganisms' biochemistry which in turn signaled changes in temperatures.

These novel insights were built on ocean sediments and particularly on the microfossils in them, which turned out to provide vast and useful data for shedding light on the deeper and less visible processes shaping our planet: data from microfossil records, for instance, provided experimental evidence for the theory of plate tectonics, for the planet's geomagnetic reversal, as well as for the effect of orbital variation on glacial cycles (see [[story.cycladophora davisiana]]). The vast apparatus required to collect these samples and data was made available thanks to a broader epochal change in the landscape of the technosciences set off by wartime research, and propelled further by postwar geopolitics: the advent of [[material.big science]]. Fuelled by massive national and military funding, this new version of science was characterized by bigger budgets, teams, labs, and instruments, and it effectively boosted the micropaleontology-oceanography connection through the development of [[material.deep sea drilling]]. Championed by [[material.william rex riedel]], [[material.cesare emiliani]], and many other scientists, the effort to explore and document the global oceans, especially their stratigraphy, gave rise to a number of research projects that continue to this day through the [[material.JOIDES]] cooperation. Thanks to these technological and conceptual transformations, industrial micropaleontology consolidated its importance not only as an applied aspect of the extractive industries, but also - increasingly - as a foundational tool in the study of the planet's dynamics and deep history. As the examples of both Riedel and Emiliani illustrate, this novel role of micropaleontology was especially associated with the ongoing effort to map Earth's history and its geological strata and resources. But, for this mapping to succeed, an impressive variety of data from different sources needed to be collected an interrelated. Museums, and other scientific institutions and collections, were going to have a pivotal role in this effort, allowing to tell novel stories [[story.of microbes and planets]].
