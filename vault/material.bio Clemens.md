Between 2003 and 2007 he worked on his thesis on the memory of the Second World War in Scandinavia at the European University Institute in Florence/Italy. Afterwards Clemens researched the escape of German Jews to Sweden between 1933 and 1945 and curated a series of exhibitions on German-Jewish history and the history of the Second World War.
