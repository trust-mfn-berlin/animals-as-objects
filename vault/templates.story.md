Stories are like materials and themes. They also get backlinks like [[theme.test]]. Stories have 2000 - 4000 words max.
And footnotes [^footnote1]. The foonote-words can be different each time, or refer to a paragraph and be numbered conscutively. Before publishing, however, they need to be changed to consecutive numbers, see [[help.markdown guide]].
And **bold** and _italics_.

## Subheadings

Where more can be said.

They can also include:
>Longer quotes from other sources, like this one...

_Image caption (less than 200 characters) and source._

<!-- Notes for us -->

### Subsubheadings are the lowest level

More text here.

## Another subheading

More text here. If you need to backlink a word that is different from the actual title, use [[themes|templates.theme]]. It should never be a word like "here", used like a normal hyperlink. It should always be a close variation of the actual title.

If you need to reference another text at the end of a sentence, it looks like this: Here is a sentence, see [[templates.story]].
Hier ist ein Satz, siehe auch [[templates.story]].

[^footnote1]: here REF: Surname, Name. _Book title_. Place: Press, YYYY
Surname, Name. "Article Title." _Journal_ 1, n1 (YYYY): p-pp.
