<!-- >**Note from Arthur**
I have added the style guide draft by Filippo as a starting point. When this note is finalised, it will be integrated into the [[templates]] and will then autofill with fitting fields for each category as you create a new material, theme or story. See [[help.file structure]] for more information regarding the existing fields and their functions. Dot dot dot-->
