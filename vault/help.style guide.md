## Style notes

### Numbers and Dates

* Dates of life only in material.person, not everywhere
* Large numbers are written as 63, 7.478, 165.000 with a dot, except for zero through twelve (null bis zwölf), which are spelled out as a word
* 19th century, 19. Jahrhundert
* Dates in the text are 12 December 1967 in EN, but 12. Dezember 1967 auf DE
* Full dates in footnotes are 30.07.1985

### Grammar and Style

- Use Oxford comma
- Use the longer dashes with spaces around it in texts – like this. Not this one: -
- Only use "these quotation marks" in both DE and EN, not „these quotation marks”
- Always leave a blank line above and below a bullet point list
- Footnotes come after the "." at the end of a sentence but before the "," if in the middle of a sentence
- Titles of publications, newspapers etc. are in _cursive_, so if used in a caption: _In an image caption, a name of a newspaper, for example_ Newspaper title, _is the only thing not in cursive_. Also italicize laws, regulations, and names of journals, etc.
- A few sentences per text/section should be in **bold**. On its own, a sentence should generate interest, and make the scrolling reader curious. Altogether with the title and the summary, they should allow the reader a brief glimpse into the topic, without reading the text. Don't make individual words **bold**, minimum is a phrase. Together with long quotes and images, they additionally function to visually break up longer texts.

### Structure and Terminology

- For every document where you care about what's written in it, there should be a material.document, because those contain full transcripts, and will be translated (unlike image descriptions)
- Zweiter Weltkrieg, Second World War
- DE: zoological garden (zoologischer Garten) without capitalization for zoos in general, but Zoological Garden (Zoologischer Garten) when talking about the Berlin zoo specifically
- When including a link to a material or theme or story, either you use the exact word, or an [[Alias|material.NSB]]. The Alternative Title/Alias should never be "here" or "in a different article", it should always be very close to the original title.
- Alternatively, you can use: ..., for more on this topic, see [[Alternative Title|material.NSB]]. Auf deutsch: ..., siehe auch [[Alternative Title|material.NSB]]. Internal backlinks have a special design, so they stand out nicely.
- Avoid quotation marks that distance you as the author from the words you use, but if you must, use 'single' ones, as the "doubles" are reserved for quotations and for animal-names like "Knut". It’s good practice to explain why, i.e. what’s not accurate about that specific word at its first use.  Then you can go on to use the single quotation marks for that specific word in that text. Another option is adding the term so-called (sogenannte) in front of a word. However, be aware that neither single quotation marks nor the term so-called undoes the colonial order transported by a word like exotic, for example. Single quotation marks are not an option for historical terminology from sources, esp. with Nazi or colonial connotations.

## Image descriptions, AltText

* Do start with general details, followed by specifics.
* Do be clear and concise. It is important not to be too wordy or over describe a panel, since this can be confusing to a reader.
* Do be objective. You do not want to put your opinions of what is happening into the description, just what is literally in the panel. The reader should have the freedom for their own interpretation given all the necessary details.
* Do state the type of image if it is unusual or out of context, like a newspaper cut-out among photographs.
* Do pay attention to the context of the image. Is it well-described within the text? Then the alt-text can be simple.
