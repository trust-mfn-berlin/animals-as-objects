For pointing someone towards a note, or to put a reminder for yourself - you can put a bidirectional link to [[help.ToDo CMW]] or similar ToDo note with your own acronym. You can then later find the notes via the backlink function in the left sidebar

You can also add links and notes to your own ToDo document - these will not be published on the final site and are a good place to store stuff.
