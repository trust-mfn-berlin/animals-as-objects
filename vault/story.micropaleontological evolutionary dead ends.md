_An image of_ Bathybius haeckelii, _which was believed to be a primordial protoplasm from the ocean floor and to offer evidence of the connection between inorganic matter and organic life. When the substance was proven to be an inorganic artifact caused by the alcohol used to preserve the samples, the controversy surrounding it contributed to slowing down early advances in micropaleontology._ [^micropaleontology1]

By the second half of the century, better observations -revolutionized the scientific understanding of nature. Significant improvements in [[story.microscopy]] after the 1830s (which led to the formulation of current [[story.cell theory]]) and the mounting evidence for the transmutation of organisms, which culminated in the 1850s with [[material.charles darwin]]'s and [[material.alfred russel wallace]]'s evolutionary theories, aided these observations. However, despite these innovations, the characterization of microbial life and its role in the functioning of the planet and its history was still only beginning to take shape. Many naturalists continued the efforts of d'Orbigny and Ehrenberg to describe and classify microbial diversity. They were driven also by the intent to overcome the creationist positions of these 'founding fathers', who still considered evolution to be unfounded. Nevertheless, these early attempts to connect microorganisms and the evolution of life on the planet met with what seemed to be a dead end. 

In the case of [[material.foraminifera]], this is evident in the work of [[material.william benjamin carpenter]], who in the 1860s rejected [[material.alcide d'orbigny]]'s systematization. Proposing a different interpretation of foraminiferans, he questioned the value of the notion of species for these organisms. Carpenter also authoritatively concluded that the great range of variation in this group was not representative of evolution into more complex forms, but instead indicated that they changed little over geological time. While dismissing the creationism of d'Orbigny, this view legitimized the misconception that foraminifera were not useful in paleontology. According to Carpenter, they had remained essentially the same throughout the planet's history. During the same time, [[material.radiolaria]] too underwent a reclassification that was more attuned to the rise of evolutionism - but also failed to recognize the evolutionary depths of these microorganisms. [[material.ernst haeckel]], a young German naturalist, chose to concentrate his doctoral work on these organisms, which until then had mostly been studied by Ehrenberg. Haeckel's goal was to organize them in a better 'natural system'. As he encountered the work of Darwin, Haeckel immediately became an ardent supporter and introduced an evolutionary perspective in his successful radiolarian work. Even an enthusiast like Haeckel, however, eventually supported the view that these microorganisms changed little and slowly over geological time. This view was consolidated with the [[material.hms challenger]] expedition in the 1870s: the first comprehensive oceanographic survey of the world's oceans. As the scientists and crew of the expedition collected thousands of specimens, observations, and data, the foremost experts of the time were mobilized to analyse and report on the expedition's findings. 

Haeckel was charged with reporting on the radiolarians and [[material.henry bowman brady]] on the foraminiferans. Detailed, rigorous, and artfully illustrated, both reports enjoyed much success and came to represent the crowning achievements of 19th century natural sciences. Their encyclopedic work - together with that of the other scientists studying the Challenger materials, still grounds much of subsequent [[story.oceanography]] and profoundly shaped our understanding of nature. But while their descriptive value is still appreciated, both reports eventually reconfirmed the mistaken idea that microorganisms evolved only slowly and over long geological ranges. Even before being truly born, micropaleontology faced a premature death, as microfossils became disconnected from geological time in these early studies.
