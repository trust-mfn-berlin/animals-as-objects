@filippo

Filippo Bertoni obtained his PhD in Amsterdam University, focusing on earthworms and their scientists. He is a researcher at the Museum für Naturkunde, in Berlin, where he investigates the transformation of animals into objects and data across the city’s natural history collections and zoological gardens. Embracing an undisciplined approach, the stories he gathers play with genres, styles, and media at the edges of imaginative fiction and various forms of academic writing. Animating the tension between reality, science, and (science)fiction, these stories resist the universalizing push of Western modernity, opening up to the multiplicity of worlds already around us.
