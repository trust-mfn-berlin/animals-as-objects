![a page from the 1766 edition of Linnaeus' Systema Naturae, describing in Latin the Class "chaos infusorium"](/images/filo/Linnaeus-chaos-infusorium.jpg)

_The final page of Linnaeus' 12th edition of the Systema Naturae, published in 1766, presenting the official description of the "chaos infusorium", placed in the class Vermes, "worms"._ [^micropaleontology1]

Ever since the earliest microscopic observations in the 17th and 18th centuries, novel instruments and techniques enabled glimpses of unexpected and complex [[theme.microbial worlds]]. At first, the diversity of microbial life appeared chaotic and undefined, so much so that in 1767 [[material.carl linnaeus]] defined all microscopic organisms as the _chaos infusorium_. But as the taxonomical ordering of the natural world proceeded, especially during the 19th century, naturalists were faced with the task of making sense of this surprising diversity. By the end of the century, this diversity no longer appeared so chaotic: recurring forms stimulated the imagination of scientists and suggested an order to these microorganisms. In this period, many attempted to describe and classify microbial organisms, collectively known as [[material.infusoria]], in ways that ran parallel to the taxonomic ordering of larger and more familiar life forms. Yet, the tools and frameworks of early taxonomy proved ill-suited to the task: as the nature of microorganisms underwent significant transformations most early classifications were rapidly replaced and overturned. To this day, they continue to surprise and confound us.

These early transformations in the understanding of microbial life had a deep impact on what was to become micropaleontology. Naturalists described impressive numbers of organisms, and gave them Latin names. These names are still in use according to the rules of binomial nomenclature and its [[theme.taxonomical orders]] [^micropaleontology2]. But while the traces of these workers are still prominent in species names (like in the case of [[story.cycladophora davisiana]]), their organizations, classifications, and understandings of microbial life were often already discredited during their own lifetimes. This is the case of two figures often remembered as the 'fathers' of micropaleontology: [[material.alcide d'orbigny]] and [[material.christian gottfried ehrenberg]]. Alcide d'Orbigny is credited with the first systematization and classification, in the 1820s, of [[material.foraminifera]] (which were later to become central to micropaleontology). However, his interpretations were not as successful as his descriptive work. He believed them to be cephalopods, and despite later revising this interpretation, he continued to controversially argue that their diverse forms were the result of 27 separate creation events [^micropaleontology3]. Unlike d'Orbigny, Ehrenberg did not focus on a specific group; instead, he attended to the broader diversity of infusoria. In 1838 he published his successful monograph _Die Infusionsthierchen als Vollkommene Organismen_. There, with the aid of detailed illustrations, he opposed the predominant hierarchical vision of taxonomy championed by Cuvier, the leading French paleontologist of the time. Cuvier had placed humans as the top of a [[material.scala naturae]], a natural, progressive, and hierarchical 'chain of beings' culminating in 'man'. But thanks to his early study of the formation of fungi from spores, Ehrenberg resisted the widespread idea that 'lower animals' would originate spontaneously from inorganic matter, a theory known as [[material.spontaneous generation]].

In his desire to refute these dominant understandings of life, which were common at the beginning of the 19th century, Ehrenberg argued that all infusoria were in fact 'complete' animals. In his microscopic observations he identified stomachs and other organs within microorganisms and claimed they justified his view. This interpretation tainted his reputation, especially as he stubbornly refused to accept the evidence that disproved his observation for the rest of his life. Thus, although his second monograph, published in 1854, laid out much of the subject matter of micropaleontology under the name of _Mikrogeologie_, his work didn't have much impact until the following century. Despite the international fame their detailed and rigorous descriptions won them, both d'Orbigny's and Ehrenberg's interpretations of microorganisms had received much criticism already during their lifetime. By the 1850s, the  _nature_ of microbial organisms had profoundly changed [^micropaleontology4].
