![a page from the 1766 edition of Linnaeus' Systema Naturae, describing in Latin the Class "chaos infusorium"](/images/filo/Linnaeus-chaos-infusorium.jpg)

_The final page of Linnaeus' 12th edition of the Systema Naturae, published in 1766, presenting the official description of the "chaos infusorium", placed in the class Vermes, "worms"._ [^micropaleontology1]

Already since the earliest microscopic observations over the course of the 17th and 18th centuries, novel instruments and techniques allowed to catch increasingly clearer glimpses of unexpected and complex [[theme.microbial worlds]]. At first, the diversity of microbial life appeared chaotic and undefined, so much so that in 1767 [[material.carl linnaeus]] defined all microscopic organisms as what he named the _chaos infusorium_. But as the taxonomical ordering of the natural world proceeded rapidly especially during the 19th century, naturalists were faced with the task of making sense of this surprising diversity, which no longer appeared so chaotic, as recurring forms suggested there was order to these microorganisms, and stimulated the imagination of scientists. In this period, many attempted to describe and classify microbial organisms, collectively known as [[material.infusoria]], in ways that ran parallel to the taxonomic ordering of larger and more familiar life forms. But the tools and frameworks of early taxonomy proved ill-suited to the task: most early classifications were rapidly replaced and overturned, as the nature of microorganisms underwent significant transformations over the course of the 19th century, and well into the 20th - and still continues to surprise us today.

These early transformations in the understanding of microbial life had a deep impact on what was to become micropaleontology, as naturalists described impressive numbers of organisms, and gave them names which are often still in use according to the rules of taxonomical nomenclature [^micropaleontology2]. But while the traces of these workers are still prominent in species names, their organizations, classifications, and understandings of microbial life were often already discredited during their own lifetimes. This is the case of two figures often indicated as the 'fathers' of micropaleontology: [[material.alcide d'orbigny]] and [[material.christian gottfried ehrenberg]]. While d'Orbigny is credited with the first systematization and classification, in the 1820s, of [[material.foraminifera]] (which were later to become central to micropaleontology), his interpretations were not as succesful as his descriptive work. He believed them to be cephalopods, and even when he revised his interpretation, he continued to controversially argue that their diverse forms were the result of 27 separate creation events [^micropaleontology3]. Unlike d'Orbigny, Ehrenberg did not focus on a specific group, but he attended to the broader diversity of infusoria, publishing in 1838 his successful monograph _Die Infusionsthierchen als Vollkommene Organismen_. There, with the aid of detailed illustrations, he opposed the predominant hierarchical vision of taxonomy championed by Cuvier, which saw humans as the higher step of a [[material.scala naturae]], a natural, progressive, and hierarchical 'chain of beings' culminating in 'man'. Thanks to his early study of the formation of fungi from spores, he also resisted the widespread idea that 'lower animals' would originate spontaneously from inorganic matter, a theory known as [[material.spontaneous generation]].

In his desire to refute these understandings of life still common at the beginning of the 19th century, though, Ehrenberg argued that all infusoria were in fact 'complete' animals, and identified stomachs and other organs in his microscopic observations. This interpretation tainted his reputation, especially as he stubbornly refused to accept the evidence that disproved his observation for the rest of his life. For this reason, even if his second monograph, published in 1854, laid out much of the subject matter of micropaleontology under the name of _Mikrogeologie_, his work didn't have much impact until the following century. Despite the fame their detailed and rigorous descriptions won them, making them international authorities in their field, both d'Orbigny's and Ehrenberg's interpretations of microorganisms came under much criticism already during their lifetime. _What microbial organisms are_, had profoundly changed already by the 1850s [^micropaleontology4].
