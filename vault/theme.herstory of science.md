<!-- Hey Filo, I wrote about Magdalena and Katharina Heinroth. Magda is totally forgotten. What about you backlink [[material.Magdalena Heinroth]] and [[material.Katharina Heinroth]] somewhere?>

Intro explaining the term and its use in current media to highlight and address the patriarchal exclusion of women's contributions to scientific history.

Then showing briefly a history of the exclusion of women and their hidden and denied role in knowledge - from Silvia Federici's power/knowledge/witchcraft/gender articulation, to the exclusion of women from formal education untill recently, with exceptions - like Maria Sybilla Meriam and other usually aristocratic figures - and how they still were essential despite marginalization - like [[material.clara ehrenberg]].
Then highlighting the sociopolitical and economic transformations brought about by WWI and the changing role of women and early figures in official science - like [[material.esther applin]], [[material.alva ellisor]], [[material.hedwig kniker]]. (And maybe differences and similarities with soviet researchers [[material.nina nicolaevna subbotina]] and [[material.dagmara maksimilianovna rauser-chernousova]]?) And how this changed even more with WWII - like zoo director. But also how the Cold War saw an active work of the patriarchy to go back to the previous situation - the 50s and 60s and the renewed repression and exclusion of women. And the ongoing effort to resist patriarchy in science.

And ending with the importance of feminist critique and feminist technosciences - and strong objectivity, cognitive justice, and successor sciences.
