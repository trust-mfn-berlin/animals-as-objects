Micropaleontology is the scientific study of microfossils, fossils that are microscopic in size and are not visible to the naked eye. As the nature of this object of study illustrates, the field is extremely diverse: microfossils can include anything, from a plethora of unicellular organisms, to microscopic larvae, to pollens, seeds, and spores, or even to fragments of larger fossils, like teeth and scales. Furthermore, these different objects can be approached in a variety of ways: as organisms in themselves, as environmental indicators, as series in time, or as proxies for other geological, environmental or biological variables. The resulting diversity of the object of micropaleontology makes it hard to trace one clear linear history of this discipline - as, unlike many other disciplines, it does not find its unity in its object of study. 

In fact, from its early onset, the study of [[theme.microbial worlds]] was faced with an extraordinary and unexpected diversity, and originated a multitude of approaches to access, understand, and organize nature at the microscopic level. This was particularly true since the 18th century, when novel techniques and instruments for observing the microscopic scale made this diversity visible, which naturalists struggled to make sense of. This is evident, for instance, in the early classification erected by Carl Linnaeus, who placed all microbial organisms in what he called the chaos infusorium. Infusoria, as microorganisms were collectively known, challenged the assumptions of scientists and stimulated their imagination, as they begged the question of what their relationship with larger organisms could be. Over the course of the 19th century, many naturalists attempted to answer this question and reconcile infusoria with the still dominant creationist understanding of the world. Most of the earlier workers who are still recognized in today micropaleontology belonged to this category: while their interpretations of microfossils were already dismissed as they still lived, their classifications are often still of value. This is the case of Alcide dâ€™Orbigny and of Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg. As the taxonomical project of ordering nature in a clear and universal system opened up more questions, the
