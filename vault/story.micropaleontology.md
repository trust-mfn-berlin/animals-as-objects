Micropaleontology is the scientific study of microfossils, fossilized remains that are microscopic in size and are not visible to the naked eye. As the nature of this object of study suggests, the field is extremely diverse: microfossils can include anything, from a plethora of unicellular organisms with different biochemistries, to microscopic larvae, pollens, seeds, and spores, to fragments of larger fossils, like teeth and scales. Microfossils have come to be many things: organisms in themselves, environmental indicators, series in evolutionary time, geochemical materials, as well as proxies for other geological, environmental or biological variables. The resulting diversity of micropaleontology makes it hard to trace one clear linear history of this discipline, which still struggles to find a unitary definition [^micropaleontology1]. Perhaps, then, rather than searching for one unitary history of this diverse field, it is useful to proceed in analogy to how micropaleontologists themselves would: trace different formations across geological strata, in order to understand the ongoing dynamic relations that connect them.

The [[story.chaotic origins of micropaleontology]] shed light on foundational structures - like [[theme.taxonomical orders]] - that still train this disciplinary field. At the same time, they track the radical changes our understanding of [[theme.microbial worlds]] has undergone. Similarly, this early history of the field illustrates how sociotechnical and conceptual conditions led this study to what appeared to be [[story.micropaleontological evolutionary dead ends]]. And yet, the revolutionary discoveries of a group of young women employed by oil companies challenged previous dogmas and resurrected the field in what came to be known as [[story.industrial micropaleontology]]. This particular applied fortune of micropaleontology, as it merged with postwar [[story.oceanography]], brought [[story.micropaleontology at sea]] once again, while also making of microfossils a crucial part of the complex vast technoscientific machinery that allows us today to tell stories and histories [[story.of microbes and planets]]. Across these formations, micropaleontology articulates not only microfossils and scientific knowledge, but also technologies, sociopolitical projects, individuals and communities (not only human). They tell stories of planetary changes and they change how we know the world.

[^micropaleontology1]: This is clear already in the title of an important 1980s article in this field: Lipps, Jere H. "What, If Anything, Is Micropaleontology?" _Paleobiology_ 7, no. 2 (1981): 167-99. Accessed April 20, 2021. http://www.jstor.org/stable/2400472. And in a more recent reprise: Martin, Ronald E. "What, if anything, is environmental micropaleontology?." _Microbiology_ 1 (2004): 1-10.
