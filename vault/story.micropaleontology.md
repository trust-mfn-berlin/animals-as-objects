Micropaleontology is the scientific study of microfossils, fossils that are microscopic in size and are not visible to the naked eye. As the nature of this object of study illustrates, the field is extremely diverse: microfossils can include anything, from a plethora of unicellular organisms, to microscopic larvae, to pollens, seeds, and spores, or even to fragments of larger fossils, like teeth and scales. Furthermore, these different objects can be approached in a variety of ways: as organisms in themselves, as environmental indicators, as series in time, as geological materials, or as proxies for other geological, environmental or biological variables. The resulting diversity of micropaleontology makes it hard to trace one clear linear history of this discipline, which still struggles to find a unitary definition([^1]). ([^1]: This is clear in the title of an important article in this field: Lipps, Jere H. "What, If Anything, Is Micropaleontology?" Paleobiology 7, no. 2 (1981): 167-99.

Already since the earliest microscopic observations over the course of the 17th and 18th century, novel instruments and techniques allowed to catch increasingly clearer glimpses of unexpected and complex [[theme.microbial worlds]]. At first, the diversity of microbial life appeared chaotic and undefined, so much so that [[material.carl linnaeus]] placed all microscopic organisms in what he called the _chaos infusorium_. But as the taxonomical ordering of the natural world proceeded rapidly during the 19th century, naturalists were faced with the task of making sense of this surprising diversity, which no longer appeared so chaotic. To this end, many attempted to describe and classify microbial organisms, known as [[material.infusoria]], in ways that ran parallel to the taxonomic ordering of larger and more familiar life forms. But the tools and frameworks of early taxonomy proved ill-suited to the task: most early classifications were quickly replaced and overturned, as the nature of microorganisms remained controversial. 

was faced with an extraordinary and unexpected diversity, and originated a multitude of approaches to access, understand, and organize nature at the microscopic level. This was particularly true since the 18th century, when novel techniques and instruments for observing the microscopic scale made this diversity visible, which naturalists struggled to make sense of. This is evident, for instance, in the early classification erected by Carl Linnaeus, who placed all microbial organisms in what he called the chaos infusorium. Infusoria, as microorganisms were collectively known, challenged the assumptions of scientists and stimulated their imagination, as they begged the question of what their relationship with larger organisms could be. Over the course of the 19th century, many naturalists attempted to answer this question and reconcile infusoria with the still dominant creationist understanding of the world. Most of the earlier workers who are still recognized in today micropaleontology belonged to this category: while their interpretations of microfossils were already dismissed as they still lived, their classifications are often still of value. This is the case of Alcide dâ€™Orbigny and of Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg. As the taxonomical project of ordering nature in a clear and universal system opened up more questions, the
