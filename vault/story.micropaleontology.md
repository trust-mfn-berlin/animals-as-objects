Micropaleontology is the scientific study of microfossils, fossilized remains that are microscopic in size and are not visible to the naked eye. As the nature of this object of study suggests, the field is extremely diverse: microfossils can include anything, from a plethora of unicellular organisms, to microscopic larvae, to pollens, seeds, and spores, or even to fragments of larger fossils, like teeth and scales. Furthermore, these different objects can be approached in a variety of ways: as organisms in themselves, as environmental indicators, as series in time, as geological materials, or as proxies for other geological, environmental or biological variables. The resulting diversity of micropaleontology makes it hard to trace one clear linear history of this discipline, which still struggles to find a unitary definition [^micropaleontology1]. 

##Chaotic origins
Already since the earliest microscopic observations over the course of the 17th and 18th century, novel instruments and techniques allowed to catch increasingly clearer glimpses of unexpected and complex [[theme.microbial worlds]]. At first, the diversity of microbial life appeared chaotic and undefined, so much so that [[material.carl linnaeus]] placed all microscopic organisms in what he called the _chaos infusorium_. But as the taxonomical ordering of the natural world proceeded rapidly during the 19th century, naturalists were faced with the task of making sense of this surprising diversity, which no longer appeared so chaotic, as recurring forms stimulated the imagination of scientists. To this end, many attempted to describe and classify microbial organisms, collectively known as [[material.infusoria]], in ways that ran parallel to the taxonomic ordering of larger and more familiar life forms. But the tools and frameworks of early taxonomy proved ill-suited to the task: most early classifications were rapidly replaced and overturned, as the nature of microorganisms underwent significant transformations over the course of the 19th century, and well into the 20th - and still continues to surprise us today. These early transformations in the understanding of microbial life had a deep impact on what was to become micropaleontology, as naturalists described impressive numbers of organisms, and gave them names which are still in use following the rules of taxonomical nomenclature [^micropaleontology2]. But while the traces of these workers are still prominent in species names, their organizations, classifications, and understandings of microbial life were often already discredited during their own lifetimes. This is the case of two figures often indicated as the 'fathers' of micropaleontology: [[material.alcide d'orbigny]] and [[material.christian gottfried ehrenberg]]. While d'Orbigny is credited with the first systematization and classification, in the 1820s, of [[material.foraminifera]] (which were later to become central to micropaleontology), his interpretations were not as succesful as his descriptive work. He believed them to be cephalopods, and even when he revised his interpretation, he continued to controversially argue that their diverse forms were the result of 27 separate creation events [^micropaleontology3]. Unlike d'Orbigny, Ehrenberg did not focus on a specific group, but he attended to the diversity of infusoria, publishing in 1838 his successful monograph _Die Infusionsthierchen als Vollkornmene Organismen_. There, with the aid of detailed illustrations, he opposed the predominant hierarchical vision of taxonomy championed by Cuvier, which saw humans as the higher step of a [[material.scala naturae]], a natural and hierarchical 'chain of beings'. Thanks to his early study of the formation of fungi from spores, he also resisted the widespread idea that 'lower animals' would originate spontaneously from inorganic matter, a theory known as [[material.spontaneous generation]]. In his desire to refute these understandings of life still common at the beginning of the 19th century, though, Ehrenberg argued that all infusoria were in fact 'complete' animals, and identified stomachs and other organs in his microscopic observations. This interpretation tainted his reputation, especially as he stubbornly refused to accept the evidence that disproved his observation for the rest of his life. For this reason, even if his next monograph, published in 1854, laid out much of the subject matter of micropaleontology under the name of _mikrogeologie_, his work didn't enjoy much circulation.
Despite the fame their detailed and rigorous descriptions won them, both d'Orbigny's and Ehrenberg's interpretations of microorganisms came under much criticism already during their lifetime. In particular, the combination of better observations - aided by significant improvements in [[story.microscopy]] after the 1830s, and of the mounting evidence for the transmutation of organisms that culminated in the 1850s with [[material.charles darwin]]'s and [[material.alfred russel wallace]]'s evolutionary theories, meant that their ideas were already widely considered surpassed by the second half of the century.

It was only after the 1850s, once [[material.charles darwin]]'s and [[material.alfred russel wallace]]'s theories of evolution through natural selection began to transform natural history, and the early formulations of cell theory were published, that microbial life and its historical and evolutionary depth started to emerge. This was particularly evident, for instance, in the work of [[material.ernst haeckel]], who in his 1862 dissertation on [[material.radiolaria]] advanced a first attempt to organize these life forms in a natural system that sought to trace their evolutionary transformations.

was faced with an extraordinary and unexpected diversity, and originated a multitude of approaches to access, understand, and organize nature at the microscopic level. This was particularly true since the 18th century, when novel techniques and instruments for observing the microscopic scale made this diversity visible, which naturalists struggled to make sense of. This is evident, for instance, in the early classification erected by Carl Linnaeus, who placed all microbial organisms in what he called the chaos infusorium. Infusoria, as microorganisms were collectively known, challenged the assumptions of scientists and stimulated their imagination, as they begged the question of what their relationship with larger organisms could be. Over the course of the 19th century, many naturalists attempted to answer this question and reconcile infusoria with the still dominant creationist understanding of the world. Most of the earlier workers who are still recognized in today micropaleontology belonged to this category: while their interpretations of microfossils were already dismissed as they still lived, their classifications are often still of value. This is the case of Alcide d’Orbigny and of Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg. As the taxonomical project of ordering nature in a clear and universal system opened up more questions, the
