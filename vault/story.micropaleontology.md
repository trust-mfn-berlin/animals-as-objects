Micropaleontology is the scientific study of microfossils, fossilized remains that are microscopic in size and are not visible to the naked eye. As the nature of this object of study suggests, the field is extremely diverse: microfossils can include anything, from a plethora of unicellular organisms, to microscopic larvae, to pollens, seeds, and spores, or even to fragments of larger fossils, like teeth and scales. Furthermore, these different objects can be approached in a variety of ways: as organisms in themselves, as environmental indicators, as series in time, as geological materials, or as proxies for other geological, environmental or biological variables. The resulting diversity of micropaleontology makes it hard to trace one clear linear history of this discipline, which still struggles to find a unitary definition [^micropaleontology1]. 

##Chaotic origins
Already since the earliest microscopic observations over the course of the 17th and 18th century, novel instruments and techniques allowed to catch increasingly clearer glimpses of unexpected and complex [[theme.microbial worlds]]. At first, the diversity of microbial life appeared chaotic and undefined, so much so that [[material.carl linnaeus]] placed all microscopic organisms in what he called the _chaos infusorium_. But as the taxonomical ordering of the natural world proceeded rapidly during the 19th century, naturalists were faced with the task of making sense of this surprising diversity, which no longer appeared so chaotic, as recurring forms stimulated the imagination of scientists. To this end, many attempted to describe and classify microbial organisms, collectively known as [[material.infusoria]], in ways that ran parallel to the taxonomic ordering of larger and more familiar life forms. But the tools and frameworks of early taxonomy proved ill-suited to the task: most early classifications were rapidly replaced and overturned, as the nature of microorganisms underwent significant transformations over the course of the 19th century, and well into the 20th - and still continues to surprise us today.

These early transformations in the understanding of microbial life had a deep impact on what was to become micropaleontology, as naturalists described impressive numbers of organisms, and gave them names which are still in use following the rules of taxonomical nomenclature [^micropaleontology2]. But while the traces of these workers are still prominent in species names, their organizations, classifications, and understandings of microbial life were often already discredited during their own lifetimes. This is the case of two figures often indicated as the 'fathers' of micropaleontology: [[material.alcide d'orbigny]] and [[material.christian gottfried ehrenberg]]. While d'Orbigny is credited with the first systematization and classification, in the 1820s, of [[material.foraminifera]] (which were later to become central to micropaleontology), his interpretations were not as succesful as his descriptive work. He believed them to be cephalopods, and even when he revised his interpretation, he continued to controversially argue that their diverse forms were the result of 27 separate creation events [^micropaleontology3]. Unlike d'Orbigny, Ehrenberg did not focus on a specific group, but he attended to the diversity of infusoria, publishing in 1838 his successful monograph _Die Infusionsthierchen als Vollkornmene Organismen_. There, with the aid of detailed illustrations, he opposed the predominant hierarchical vision of taxonomy championed by Cuvier, which saw humans as the higher step of a [[material.scala naturae]], a natural and hierarchical 'chain of beings'. Thanks to his early study of the formation of fungi from spores, he also resisted the widespread idea that 'lower animals' would originate spontaneously from inorganic matter, a theory known as [[material.spontaneous generation]].

In his desire to refute these understandings of life still common at the beginning of the 19th century, though, Ehrenberg argued that all infusoria were in fact 'complete' animals, and identified stomachs and other organs in his microscopic observations. This interpretation tainted his reputation, especially as he stubbornly refused to accept the evidence that disproved his observation for the rest of his life. For this reason, even if his next monograph, published in 1854, laid out much of the subject matter of micropaleontology under the name of _mikrogeologie_, his work didn't enjoy much circulation. Despite the fame their detailed and rigorous descriptions won them, making them international authorities in their field, both d'Orbigny's and Ehrenberg's interpretations of microorganisms came under much criticism already during their lifetime. _What microbial organisms are_ had profoundly changed by the 1850s [^micropaleontology4]. 

##Evolutionary dead ends
By the second half of the century, better observations - aided by significant improvements in [[story.microscopy]] after the 1830s (which led to the formulation of current [[story.cell theory]]), and the mounting evidence for the transmutation of organisms (that culminated in the 1850s with [[material.charles darwin]]'s and [[material.alfred russel wallace]]'s evolutionary theories), revolutionized the scientific understanding of nature. Despite these innovations, though, the characterization of microbial life and its role in the functioning of the planet and its history was still only beginning to take shape. While many naturalists took over the endeavour started by d'Orbigny and Ehrenberg of describing and classifying microbial diversity overcoming their creationism, these early attempts to connect microorganisms and the evolution of life on the planet met with an apparent dead end. 

In the case of [[material.foraminifera]], this is evident in the work of [[material.william benjamin carpenter]], who in the 1860s rejected [[material.alcide d'orbigny]]'s systematization. Proposing a different interpretation of foraminiferans, he questioned the value of the notion of species for these organisms. Carpenter also authoritatively concluded that the great range of variation in this group was not representative of evolution into more complex forms, but instead indicated that they changed little over geological time. While dismissing the creationism of d'Orbigny, this view also legitimized the misconception that foraminifera were not useful in paleontology, as they supposedly remained essentially the same throughout the planet's history. In the same years, also [[material.radiolaria]] underwent a similar reclassification that was more attuned to the rise of evolutionism. [[material.ernst haeckel]], a young German naturalist, worked on these organisms - until then mostly studied by Ehrenberg - with the goal of organizing them in a better 'natural system'. As he encountered the work of Darwin, Haeckel became an ardent supporter, and introduced an evolutionary perspective in his successful radiolarian work. But even an enthusiast like Haeckel ended up supporting the view that these microorganisms changed little and slowly over geological time. This view was consolidated with the [[material.hms challenger]] expedition in the 1870s: the first comprehensive oceanographic survey of the world's oceans. As the scientists and crew of the expedition collected thousands of specimens and data, the foremost experts of the time were mobilized to analyse and report on the expedition's findings. 

Haeckel was charged with reporting on the radiolarians and [[material.henry bowman brady]] on the foraminiferans. Detailed, rigorous, and artfully illustrated, both reports enjoyed much success, as they represented the crowning achievement of 19th century natural sciences. Their encyclopedic work still grounds much of subsequent [[story.oceanography]] and profoundly shaped our understanding of nature. But, while their descriptive value is still appreciated, both reports eventually reconfirmed the mistaken idea that microorganisms evolved only slowly and over long geological timeframes. Even before being officially born, micropaleontology faced a premature death, as microfossils became disconnected from geological time in these early studies.
