title: Micropaleontological Formations
desc: Micropaleontology is the scientific study of microfossils, fossils that are microscopic in size and therefore are not visible to the naked eye. As the nature of this object of study suggests, the field is extremely diverse and dynamic; tracing its history is akin to the work of micropaleontologists. Like these scientists as they study seemingly static geological strata and formations to understand the complex dynamics constantly shaping and reshaping our planet, to understand the history of this discipline, we need to grasp the dynamics of its stratifications over time.

Micropaleontology is the scientific study of microfossils, fossilized remains that are microscopic in size and are not visible to the naked eye. As the nature of this object of study suggests, the field is extremely diverse: microfossils can include anything, from a plethora of unicellular organisms with different biochemistries, to microscopic larvae, to pollens, seeds, and spores, or even to fragments of larger fossils, like teeth and scales. Furthermore, these different objects can be approached in a variety of ways: as organisms in themselves, as environmental indicators, as series in time, as geochemical materials, or as proxies for other geological, environmental or biological variables. The resulting diversity of micropaleontology makes it hard to trace one clear linear history of this discipline, which still struggles to find a unitary definition [^micropaleontology1]. For this reason, rather than talking about one unitary version of the formation of this discipline, this essay traces several formations, like geological strata constantly dynamic and transforming, to highlight how micropaleontology shapes our understanding of the planet in ways that are analogous to the very transformations it studies.
