Welcome to the Animals as Objects Dendron vault! We have a guide here to help you get started writing, linking and learning. 

Each topic is covered in a separate Dendron file, linked below:

#### 1. Understanding the VSCode and Dendron interface

The VSCode interface can be overwhelming at first. Read the full help article to learn about it in detail.

#### 3. Creating, linking, renaming notes
