Welcome to the Animals as Objects Dendron vault! We have a guide here to help you get started writing, linking and learning. 

If you're already setup, check the [[help.session guide]].

Each topic is covered in a separate Dendron file, linked below:



## 1. 🚨 Understanding the VSCode and Dendron interface

The VSCode interface can be overwhelming at first. Read the full help article to learn about it in detail.

[[help.interface]]

## 2. ✍️ Writing in Markdown

Content in Dendron is written with a special syntax called **Markdown**. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown is different, in that you add _special_ **syntax** to the text to indicate which parts should look and behave differently.

## 3. 🌱 Creating, linking, renaming notes

Dendron has some special commands to create and link notes. Read more here: [[help.dendron commands]]

## 4. 🔗 Collaboration and version control

We are working together using `Git` as a collaboration tool. **There are some specific steps you need to take everytime you start and end a work session to make sure that your work can be in sync with the rest of the team.**

Read the article: [[help.version control]]

## 5. 🗄 File names, File structure, metadata and content

Markdown files in Dendron are split between `Frontmatter`, that contains meta information, and the `body`, that contains the content of the file. 

Learn more here: [[help.file structure]]

## 6. 🌈 Customising VSCode

Because VSCode is a fully-fledged developer environment, it is extensively customisable. Read more here [[help.customise vscode]]
