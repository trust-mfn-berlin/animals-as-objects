Welcome to the Animals as Objects Dendron vault! We have a guide here to help you get started writing, linking and learning. 

Each topic is covered in a separate Dendron file, linked below:

#### 1. Understanding the VSCode and Dendron interface

The VSCode interface can be overwhelming at first. Read the full help article to learn about it in detail.

[[help.interface]]

#### 2. Writing in Markdown

Unlike consumer applications like Word, Dendron uses Markdown to format text.

Read the article: [[help.markdown guide]]

#### 3. Creating, linking, renaming notes

Dendron has some special commands to create and link notes. Read more here [[help.dendron commands]]

#### 4. Collaboration and version control

We are working together using `Git` as a collaboration tool. **There are some specific steps you need to take everytime you start and end a work session to make sure that your work can be in sync with the rest of the team.**

[[help.version control]]

#### 5. File names, File structure, metadata and content

Markdown files in Dendron are split between `Frontmatter`, that contains meta information, and the `body`, that contains the content of the file. Learn more here:
