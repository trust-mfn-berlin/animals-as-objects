desc: Thanks to complex technoscientific networks, Cycladophora has become an
  important tool in the study of planetary systems and climate. This story
  follows the microorganism’s trajectory, to trace how these networks formed,
  and how they continue to shape how we know the planet - and its microbial
  inhabitants.

:::EN:::

Stories are like materials and themes. They also get backlinks like [[theme.test]]. Stories have 2000 - 4000 words max.
And footnotes [^footnote1]. The foonote-words can be different each time, or refer to a paragraph and be numbered conscutively. Before publishing, however, they need to be changed to consecutive numbers, see [[help.markdown guide]].
And **bold** and _italics_.

## Subheadings

Where more can be said.

They can also include:
>Longer quotes from other sources, like this one...

_Image caption (less than 200 characters) and source._

<!-- Notes for us -->

### Subsubheadings are the lowest level

More text here.

## Another subheading

More text here. If you need to backlink a word that is different from the actual title, use [[themes|templates.theme]]. It should never be a word like "here", used like a normal hyperlink. It should always be a close variation of the actual title.

If you need to reference another text at the end of a sentence, it looks like this: Here is a sentence, see [[templates.story]].
Hier ist ein Satz, siehe auch [[templates.story]].

[^footnote1]: here REF: Surname, Name. _Book title_. Place: Press, YYYY
Surname, Name. "Article Title." _Journal_ 1, n1 (YYYY): p-pp.
