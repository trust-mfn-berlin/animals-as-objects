:::EN:::

Text body (up to 500 words) with backlinks like this: [[theme.test]]. The title is already written above.
If needed you can also add footnotes [^footnote1]. The word does not need to be footnote.
As necessary, things can be **bold** or _italic_. 50 - 500 words max.
They can also include:
>Longer quotes from other sources, like this one...

_Image caption (less than 200 characters) and source._

If you need to backlink a word that is different from the actual title, use [[themes|templates.theme]].  It should never be a word like "here", used as a hyperlink. It should always be a close variation of the actual title.

If you need to reference another text at the end of a sentence, it looks like this: Here is a sentence, see [[templates.story]].
Hier ist ein Satz, siehe auch [[templates.story]].
