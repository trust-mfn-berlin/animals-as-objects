If you need to backlink a word that is different from the actual title, use [[themes|templates.theme]].  It should never be a word like "here", used as a hyperlink. It should always be a close variation of the actual title.

If you need to reference another text at the end of a sentence, it looks like this: Here is a sentence, see [[templates.story]].
Hier ist ein Satz, siehe auch [[templates.story]].
