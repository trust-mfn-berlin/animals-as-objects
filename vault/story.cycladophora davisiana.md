_Cycladophora davisiana_ is a species of [[material.radiolaria]], a group of unicellular microorganism widespread in the world's oceans whose body is supported by siliceous structures resembling shells, called tests. In particular, _C. davisiana_ is characteristic of high latitude waters (as the Latin name suggests, by recalling its original collection from the Davis strait, off the coast of Greenland). This species thrives in subglacial mesopelagic (of intermediate depth) waters, like the present-day Sea of Okhotsk, between the North of Japan and the Kamchatka peninsula [^image6]. The original specimen, on which the organism's first description, in 1862, was based, remains preserved in the Museum fur Naturkunde's micropaleontology collection in Berlin. This particular species is tightly intertwined with the history of [[story.micropaleontology]], because it became an important tool in the complex apparatus of [[theme.planetary data]].

## Finding _Cycladophora_

Like many other species, _Cycladophora davisiana_ was not "discovered" during a scientific expedition, but it was the by-product from a venture of a different nature. On the 29th of August 1859, the _Wiman_, a small sailing bark of 197 tons, set sail from the harbour of Boston, headed to London. Chartered by Colonel [[material.taliaferro preston schaffner]], the ship was carrying him, along with his wife and their entire household, to Denmark, by way of England. This move was part of Schaffner's venture to establish a [[story.north atlantic telegraph line]] that would connect Europe to North America. While a direct line between Newfoundland and Ireland had already been laid at great cost only the year before, that first transatlantic connection had been marred by a weak signal, and eventually failed after only a few weeks of transmissions. This failure only strengthened Schaffner's resolve, who had forseen this problem. To overcome it, his line was to proceed on land across Greenland, Iceland, and the Faer Oer islands, promising a much more consistent signal. So, as "Tal" Schaffner moved to Europe to find backing for his proposal, he instructed the crew to survey this alternative route. Along the way, he had them collect samples, data, and observations to support his proposal, confirm its feasibility, and add a more scientific character to the whole enterprise. It was in one of these samples, collected from the ocean floor in the Davis strait off the coast of Greenland, that the first specimen of _Cycladophora davisiana_ to bear this name was found. As he arrived in the UK, Schaffner arranged - through his fellow telegraphy expert, businessman, and inventor [[material.werner siemens]] - for his samples to be sent to Berlin to be analysed by [[material.christian gottfried ehrenberg]].

## Classifying _Cycladophora_
At the time, Ehrenberg was one of the foremost experts in the world on what was known back then as [[material.infusoria]] - what we nowadays call microorganisms. He had already established a global network of correspondents (including [[material.charles darwin]]), who were sending him material collected around the world for his analyses and studies. And so, he was not unprepared when he received 8 bottles with deep sea sediment samples from Schaffner's survey. Ehrenberg proceeded to wash, filter, and observe the samples. In this way he identified and classified the different microfossils found in the samples. _Cycladophora davisiana_ was among them: a microscopic siliceous shell, all that remained of a long dead microorganism. As he did with all his samples, he mounted the microscopic fossils on microscope slides made of mica (analogous to current glass slides), and covered them with Canada balsam, a viscous resin which remains transparent but solidifies with time. This was the common technique for making [[material.microscopic preparations]], and allowed him return to the samples later on [^image3]. After sharing his results with Schaffner, who passed by the Prussian capital on his way to Denmark, Ehrenberg proceeded to present them in front of the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1861. The following year, the results were published in the _Monatsberichte der KÃ¶niglichen Preussische Akademie des Wissenschaften zu Berlin_: to this day, this remains the reference description of _C. davisiana_. While Ehrenberg's description still has priority according to current [[theme.taxonomical orders]], his classification rapidly underwent significant criticism, in step with a changing understanding of microorganisms. The same year the description of Cycladophora was published, another young German naturalist, [[material.ernst haeckel]], turned his dissertation into a successful and elegant monograph on [[material.radiolaria]]. Due to Haeckel's stunning illustrations and detailed descriptions, this volume, and its reclassification of these microorganisms along the principles of Darwin's evolutionary theory, quickly turned its author into one of the leading authorities on radiolaria. As it propelled Haeckel's success as a fervent supporter and popularizer of Darwin, the volume also continued and consolidated an aesthetic tradition in the visualization of natural history, extending it to the wonders of [[theme.microbial worlds]] [^image6]. Unlike Ehrenberg, who believed infusoria to be complete animals, with digestive organs just like larger animals, Haeckel considered them unicellular ancestors of more complex life forms. This understanding was built on the [[story.cell theory]] that was emerging at the time - and that Ehrenberg opposed. But, while Haeckel tried to arrange radiolarians (including _C. davisiana_) into a natural system that represented their own evolutionary history, he became convinced that these changes were _slow_. Haeckel came to think that radiolarian species had long ranges and had remained mostly the same over the planet's geological history. This belief was confirmed in Haeckel's detailed report on the radiolaria of the [[material.hms challenger]] oceanographic expedition. Doing so, Haeckel inadvertently almost consigned radiolaria to what seemed to be [[story.micropaleontological evolutionary dead ends]], as naturalists focused on other species which were considered more interesting and useful - and _Cycladophora davisiana_ became almost 'invisible' again.

## _Cycladophora_ and planetary history
Partly because of Haeckel's interpretation, radiolaria remained at the margins of natural sciences until the 1950s. But when a young graduate student - [[material.william rex riedel]] - reassessed Haeckel's report on this neglected group, he realized that the German naturalist had mixed together current radiolarians and more ancient ones. Furthermore, during wartime the exploration of the ocean floor had rapidly developed; it was now possible to more clearly resolve the evolution of radiolarian species along the stratigraphic record. Thanks to Riedel, radiolarians had a front row seat to this return of [[story.micropaleontology at sea]]. As the study of microfossils grew closer to [[story.oceanography]], radiolarians revealed their potential for shedding light on the deep history and dynamics of our planet. Given its distribution in glacial waters at high latitudes, _Cycladophora davisiana_ was going to have a particularly important role in these stories [[story.of microbes and planets]]. This is because [[material.foraminifera]], which had been used in [[material.biostratigraphy]] since the advent of [[story.industrial micropaleontology]] in the 1920s, are not as well preserved in high latitude sediments because of their carbonate biochemistry. In contrast, radiolarians are more widespread and better preserved in these sediments because of their siliceous tests. Furthermore, _Cycladophora_'s climatic preferences connect their abundance to glacial and interglacial variations in temperatures. For these reasons _Cycladophora davisiana_ quickly became an important stratigraphic tool. This career was furthered by the success of [[material.JOIDES]] and [[material.deep sea drilling]], which were endeavouring to collect an ever-increasing number of oceanic sediment cores. This convergence of oceanographic exploration, sociotechnical changes, and geopolitical concerns placed this modest microorganism center stage: in 1976 a landmark paper published in _Science_ used abundances of _Cycladophora davisiana_ from two oceanic cores (along with oxygen isotope fractionation in foraminiferal shells) to demonstrate the hypothesized relation between ice-age cycles and planetary orbital dynamics [^image4]. While the fossil record of this microorganism continues to grow in accuracy and resolution, _Cycladophora davisiana_ continues its scientific afterlife as an important gear in the "vast machine" that subtends current climate sciences [^image5].
