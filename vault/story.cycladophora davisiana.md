_Cycladophora davisiana_ is a species of [[material.radiolaria]], a group of unicellular microorganism widespread in the world's oceans whose body is supported by siliceous structures resembling shells, called tests. In particular, _C. davisiana_ is characteristic of high latitude waters (as the Latin name suggests, by recalling its original collection from the Davis strait, off the coast of Greenland). This species thrives in subglacial mesopelagic (of intermediate depth) waters, like the present-day Sea of Okhotsk, between the North of Japan and the Kamchatka peninsula [^image6]. The original specimen on which the first description, in 1862, was based is still preserved in the Museum fur Naturkunde's micropaleontology collection in Berlin. This particular species is tightly intertwined in the history of [[story.micropaleontology]], as it became an important tool in the complex apparatus of [[theme.planetary data]].

##Finding _Cycladophora_

The 29th of August 1859, the _Wiman_, a small sailing bark of 197 tons, set sail from the harbour of Boston, headed to London. Chartered by Colonel [[material.taliaferro preston schaffner]], the ship was carrying him, along with his wife and their entire household, to Denmark, by way of England. This move was part of Schaffner's venture to establish a [[story.north atlantic telegraph line]] that would connect Europe to North America. In fact, while a direct line between Newfoundland and Ireland had already been laid at great cost only the year before, that first transatlantic connection had been marred by a weak signal since the beginning, and eventually failed after only a few weeks of transmissions. This failure only strengthened Schaffner's resolve, as in his proposal he had forseen this problem, and his line was meant to overcome it by proceeding on land in Greenland, Iceland, and the Faer Oer islands, promising a much more consistent signal. So, as "Tal" Schaffner moved to Europe to find backing for his proposal, he instructed the crew to survey his alternative route. Along the way, he had them collect samples, data, and observations to support his proposal. It was in one of these samples, collected from the ocean floor off the coast of Greenland, in the Davis strait, that the first specimen of _Cycladophora davisiana_ to bear this name was going to be found. As he arrived in the UK, Schaffner arranged - through his fellow telegraphy expert, businessman, and inventor [[material.werner siemens]] - to send his samples to Berlin to be analysed by [[material.christian gottfried ehrenberg]].

##Classifying _Cycladophora_
At the time, Professor Ehrenberg was one of the foremost expert in the world on what was known back then as [[material.infusoria]] - or, as we would call them today, microorganisms. He had already an established global network of correspondents (including [[material.charles darwin]]), who sent him material collected around the world for his analyses and studies; so he was not unprepared when he received 8 bottles with deep sea sediment samples from Schaffner's survey. Ehrenberg proceeded to wash, filter, and observe the samples, and to identify different microfossils, and classify them. _Cycladophora davisiana_ was among them: a microscopic siliceous shell, all that remained of a long dead microorganism. As he did with all his samples, he mounted the microscopic fossils on microscope slides made of mice, and covered them with Canada balsam to preserve them - the common technique for making [[material.microscopic preparations]] - so that he could return to them later on [^image3]. After sharing his results with Schaffner, who passed by the Prussian capital on his way to Denmark, Ehrenberg proceeded to present them in front of the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1861. The following year, the results were published in the _Monatsberichte der Königlichen Preussische Akademie des Wissenschaften zu Berlin_, and are still today the reference description of _C. davisiana_. Even though his description still has priority according to current [[theme.taxonomical orders]], Ehrenberg's classification rapidly underwent significant changes, as the understanding of microorganisms was changing at the time. The same year the description of Cycladophora was published, another young German naturalist, [[material.ernst haeckel]], turned his dissertation into a successful and elegant monograph on [[material.radiolaria]]. Also thanks to Haeckel's stunning illustrations, this volume, and its reclassification of these microorganisms along the principles and ideas of Darwin's evolutionary theory, would quickly turn Haeckel into one of the leading authorities on radiolaria - and a fervent supporter and popularizer of Darwin. Unlike Ehrenberg, who believed infusoria to be complete animals, with digestive organs just like larger animals, Haeckel considered them unicellular ancestors of more complex life forms - building on the [[story.cell theory]] that was emerging at the time. But, while Haeckel tried to arrange radiolarians (including _C. davisiana_) into a natural system that represented their own evolutionary history, he became convinced that these changes were slow, and that radiolarian species had long ranges, and had remained mostly the same over the planet's geological history. This belief was confirmed in Haeckel's detailed report on the radiolaria of the [[material.hms challenger]] oceanographic expedition, and lead radiolaria to what seemed to be, for a while, [[story.micropaleontological evolutionary dead ends]], as naturalists focused on other species which were considered more interesting and useful.

##_Cycladophora_ and planetary history
Also because of Haeckel's interpretation, radiolaria remained at the margins of natural sciences until the 1950s. But, when a young graduate student - [[material.william rex riedel]] - reassessed Haeckel's report on this neglected group, he realized the German naturalist had mixed together current radiolarians and more ancient ones. As the exploration of the ocean floor had rapidly developed during wartime, it was now possible to more clearly resolve the evolution of radiolarian species along the stratigraphic record. Thanks to Riedel, radiolarians had a front row sit to this return of [[story.micropaleontology at sea]]. As the study of microfossils grew closer to [[story.oceanography]], radiolarians revealed their potential for shedding light on the deep history and dynamics of our planet. Thanks to its distribution in glacial waters at high latitudes, _Cycladophora davisiana_ was going to have a particularly important role in these stories [[story.of microbes and planets]]. This is because [[material.foraminifera]], which had been used in [[material.biostratigraphy]] since the advent of [[story.industrial micropaleontology]] in the 1920s, are not as well preserved in high latitude sediments because of their carbonate biochemistry. Radiolarians, instead, thanks to their siliceous tests, are more widespread in these sediments, and better preserved. Furthermore, _Cycladophora_'s abundances have been shown to be tightly connected to glacial and interglacial variations in temperatures, thanks to their climatic preferences. For these reasons _Cycladophora davisiana_ quickly became an important stratigraphic tool, especially thanks to the success of [[material.JOIDES]] and [[material.deep sea drilling]], as they collected an ever-increasing number of oceanic sediment cores. This convergence of oceanographic exploration, sociotechnical changes, and geopolitical concerns brough this modest microorganism from the margins of scientific attention all the way to the spotlights: in 1976 a landmark paper published in _Science_ used abundances of _Cycladophora davisiana_ from two oceanic cores (along with oxygen isotope fractionation in foraminiferal shells) to demonstrate the hypothesized relation between ice-age cycles and planetary orbital dynamics [^image4]. As the fossil record of this microorganism continues to grow in accuracy and resolution, _Cycladophora davisiana_ continues its scientific afterlife as an important gear in the "vast machine" that subtends current climate sciences [^image5].
