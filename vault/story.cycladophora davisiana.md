##Finding _Cycladophora_

The 29th of August 1859, the _Wiman_, a small sailing bark of 197 tons, set sail from the harbour of Boston, headed to London. Chartered by Colonel [[material.taliaferro preston schaffner]], the ship was carrying him, along with his wife and their entire household, to Denmark, by way of England. This move was part of Schaffner's venture to establish a [[story.north atlantic telegraph line]] that would connect Europe to North America. In fact, while a direct line between Newfoundland and Ireland had already been laid at great cost only the year before, that first transatlantic connection had been marred by a weak signal since the beginning, and eventually failed after only a few weeks of transmissions. This failure only strengthened Schaffner's resolve, as in his proposal he had forseen this problem, and his line was meant to overcome it by proceeding on land in Greenland, Iceland, and the Faer Oer islands, promising a much more consistent signal. So, as "Tal" Schaffner moved to Europe to find backing for his proposal, he instructed the crew to survey his alternative route. Along the way, he had them collect samples, data, and observations to support his proposal. It was in one of these samples, collected from the ocean floor off the coast of Greenland, in the Davis strait, that the first specimen of _Cycladophora davisiana_ to bear this name was going to be found. As he arrived in the UK, Schaffner arranged - through his fellow telegraphy expert, businessman, and inventor [[material.werner siemens]] - to send his samples to Berlin to be analysed by [[material.christian gottfried ehrenberg]].

##Classifying _Cycladophora_
At the time, Professor Ehrenberg was one of the foremost expert in the world on what was known back then as [[material.infusoria]] - or, as we would call them today, microorganisms. He had already an established global network of correspondents (including [[material.charles darwin]]), who sent him material collected around the world for his analyses and studies; so he was not unprepared when he received 8 bottles with deep sea sediment samples from Schaffner's survey. Ehrenberg proceeded to wash, filter, and observe the samples, and to identify different microfossils, and classify them. _Cycladophora davisiana_ was among them: a microscopic siliceous shell, all that remained of a long dead microorganism. After sharing his results with Schaffner, who passed by the Prussian capital on his way to Denmark, Ehrenberg proceeded to present them in front of the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1861. The following year, the results were published in the _Monatsberichte der Königlichen Preussische Akademie des Wissenschaften zu Berlin_, and are still today the reference description of _C. davisiana_. Even though his description still has priority according to current [[theme.taxonomical orders]], Ehrenberg's classification rapidly underwent significant changes, as the understanding of microorganisms was changing at the time. The same year the description of Cycladophora was published, another young German naturalist, [[material.ernst haeckel]], turned his dissertation into a successful and elegant monograph on [[material.radiolaria]]. Also thanks to Haeckel's stunning illustrations, this volume, and its reclassification of these microorganisms along the principles and ideas of Darwin's evolutionary theory, would quickly turn Haeckel into one of the leading authorities on radiolaria - and a fervent supporter and popularizer of Darwin.
