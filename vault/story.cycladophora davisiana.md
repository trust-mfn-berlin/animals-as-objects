##Finding _Cycladophora_

The 29th of August 1859, the _Wiman_, a small sailing bark of 197 tons, set sail from the harbour of Boston, headed to London. Chartered by Colonel [[material.taliaferro preston schaffner]], the ship was carrying him, along with his wife and their entire household, to Denmark, by way of England. This move was part of Schaffner's venture to establish a [[story.north atlantic telgraph line]] that would connect Europe to the Americas. In fact, while a direct line between Newfoundland and Ireland had already been laid at great cost only the year before, that first transatlantic connection had been marred by a weak signal since the beginning, and eventually failed after only a few weeks of transmissions. This failure only strengthened Schaffner's resolve, as his proposed line was meant to overcome the failure of the direct line by proceeding on land in Greenland, Iceland, and the Faer Oer islands, promising a much more consistent signal. So, as he moved to Europe to lobby and work on his proposal, Schaffner instructed the crew to survey his alternative route. Along the way, he had the crew collect samples, data, and observations to support his proposal. It was in one of these samples, collected from the ocean floor off the coast of Greenland, that the first specimen of _Cycladophora davisiana_ to bear this name was going to be found. As he arrived in the UK, Schaffner arranged - through his fellow telegraphy expert, businessman, and inventor [[material.werner siemens]] - to send his sample to Berlin to be analysed by [[material.christian gottfried ehrenberg]].
