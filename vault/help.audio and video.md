## How to embed audio

Enter this in your markdown file.

`<sound file="/audio/Sample_audio_elefant.mp3">_Audio caption Elephant doing it's thing 1994_</sound>`

Where the the text `"/audio/Sample_audio_elefant.mp3"` will be the path to your audio file that you copied into the audio folder. Don't forget to put it in between quotes `"`

This will not show in the Dendron preview unfortunately.

Captions for audio should live between `<sound file="/audio/..."> Caption </sound>` tags
