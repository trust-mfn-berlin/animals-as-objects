## About the website

_Animals as Objects?_ is published by the research project [Animals as Objects. Zoological Gardens and Natural History Museum Berlin, 1810 to 2020](https://www.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/en/science/animals-objects). This website makes our research results on selected objects, histories, and species of animals available to German- and English-speaking audiences. We share historical, archival, and ethnographic answers to the question: How have animals been turned into natural history objects and data?

Relational databases, the very databases that are often used to record and manage natural history collections, inspired the conceptual and visual design. There are three different types of articles:

-   _Materials_ focus on specific photos, objects, documents, events, etc.
-   _Stories_ answer big and small research questions through _materials_ and other sources.
-   _Themes_ address the bigger picture that links many different _stories_ and _materials._

They are interconnected in many different and sometimes surprising ways, emerging from the authors’ situatedness (in a discipline, institution, subject position) and interests.

_Routes_ are curated sets of articles, selected to raise new questions beyond the scope initially envisioned by the authors. Routes extend the invitation to read the selected articles together, through a particular lens. They can be used as reading packages for classes.

All technical components are open source. We worked collaboratively on [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/), synchronised via [git](https://git-scm.com/), and published directly from git through a self-hosted version of the content management system [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). [Arthur and Son La will provide one more sentence on the technical components.]

#### Filippo Bertoni

Filippo Bertoni obtained his PhD at Amsterdam University, focusing on earthworms and their scientists. He is a researcher at the Museum für Naturkunde, in Berlin, where he investigates the transformation of animals into objects and data across the city’s natural history collections and zoological gardens. Embracing an undisciplined approach, the stories he gathers play with genres, styles, and media at the edges of imaginative fiction and various forms of academic writing. Animating the tension between reality, science, and (science)fiction, these stories resist the universalizing push of Western modernity, opening up to the multiplicity of worlds already around us.
