:::EN:::

Taxonomy (from the Greek _taxis_, order, and _nomos_, law) refers to ways to classify and categorize reality. Broadly, then, taxonomies can be found anywhere and can refer to any sort of thing; but **in biology,** taxonomy has come to refer to a specific system for ordering and classifying all forms of life. In this narrower biological sense, **taxonomy is a formal system to name, define, and classify groups of organisms, regulated and governed by agreed upon rules**, communities of experts, and by international scientific institutions.

This formal system has its origins in the work of [[material.carl linnaeus]], in the 18th century. Like many other early naturalists, Linnaeus intended to build a classification that could encompass all of God’s creatures. While he did imagine some of the categories he identified as natural classes, his system was consciously an artificial one – designed with practical concerns in mind. In particular, he introduced the standard ranks of kingdom, class, order, genus, and species, and another important standard, binomial nomenclature – the use of two Latin names to define species. Thanks to these features, and to Linnaeus’ own vast compilatory work, his system had an enormous success – and it is still in current use, at least in some crucial formal respects. In fact, two different books published by Linnaeus are officially considered the starting point of contemporary botanical and zoological taxonomy, the 1753 _Species Plantarum_, and the 10th edition of the _Systema Naturae_ published in 1758, respectively.

Despite the success of the Linnaean system, **biological taxonomy has never been stable nor universal. From its inception, the system has been accompanied by controversies. Even today classifications continue to change.** For instance, the traditions of botany and zoology began to diverge already with Linnaeus, resulting in two different codes regulating animal and plant nomenclatures – respectively, the _International Code of Zoological Nomenclature_, and what used to be the botanical code. Especially from the 20th century onward, organisms that did not fit the Linnaean ranks began to be described, like fungi, protists, and other (often microscopic) groups of life forms. This complicated the regulation of taxonomic nomenclature even more. As a consequence, the botanical code became the _International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants_, and after the 1960s developed into the _International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria_ and the _International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses_.

Despite their early divergence, both plants and animal systematics underwent a significant transformation over the course of the 19th century, which radically changed taxonomy. Taxonomical orders developed into powerful systems for naturalizing difference. Furthermore, as ranks were often presented graphically as trees (dendrograms), the idea of taxonomical differences as evidence of the natural transmutation of species became increasingly popular. By the end of the 1850s, as [[material.charles darwin]] and [[material.alfred russel wallace]] presented their theories about the origin of species, the classification of organisms started representing relations of descent within the scope of the emerging theory of evolution by natural selection. **From an order based on explicitly artificial categories, taxonomy increasingly became understood as a natural system, grounded in evolutionary change.**

_One of the earliest representations of a phylogenetic tree, indicating the evolutionary relations between different classes of organisms, according to [[material.ernst haeckel]]. Published in Haeckel, Ernst. Generelle Morphologie der Organismen: allgemeine Grundzüge der organischen Formen-Wissenschaft, mechanisch begründet durch die von C. Darwin reformirte Decendenz-Theorie. Berlin. (1866)._

This transformation of taxonomy is well represented in [[material.ernst haeckel]]’s illustration of the evolutionary relations of descent connecting all of life, published in his _Generelle Morphologie der Organismen_ from 1866. With it, Haeckel also introduced a successful new rank, that of phylum, an intermediary between kingdom and class. However, the tension between a purely morphological or descriptive concern with taxonomy, and an evolutionary and phylogenetic interest for natural classes, was never solved. This tension is somewhat reflected in the distinction between alpha and beta taxonomy that emerged in the beginning of the 20th century – the first supposedly concerned with the description of taxa, and the latter with higher ranks and broader questions. This distinction continues to highlight an implicit strain between natural history’s systematic effort to catalog all of nature, and evolutionary biology’s desire to characterize the relation of descent of all living things. Even the [[material.modern evolutionary synthesis]], that began surfacing in the 1950s to reconcile Darwinian evolutionary theory and Mendelian [[material.genetics]], did not manage to stabilize a universal approach to taxonomy.

Even as molecular and computational biology came to revolutionize the life sciences especially since the 1980s, taxonomy failed to be fully standardized. Cladistics came to dominate the classificatory effort, but the nomenclature code specifically developed for this approach – _PhyloCode_ – has never replaced the various other codes in existence. **As a practical tool for scientists, taxonomy continues to include a number of different approaches, traditions, and concerns**, which are reflected in the variety of taxonomical orders used by different parts of the scientific community. In fact, many scientists prefer to use particular taxonomies that fit their specialized interests, rather than attempting a holistic and universalist compilation. **More than a conceptual synthesis, what seems to be effective in bringing together diverging taxonomical orders and resolving (or by-passing) ongoing controversies have been pragmatic tools, like digital [[material.databases]]**. Allowing for easier access, arguably more democratic community participation, and, importantly, more standardization, precision, and computational volume, digital databases have proliferated. The _Encyclopedia of Life_, the _Global Biodiversity Information Facility_, the _NCBI taxonomy database_, the _Open Tree of Life_, and the _Catalogue of Life_ are only some of the most significant databases; the more they are used, the more successful and established they become – in a positive feedback loop that is transforming taxonomy’s practices. These digital resources for biological taxonomy help scientists who might not always have the opportunity to keep up with ever-expanding and changing classifications. They have, in a way, revolutionized taxonomy. Yet, privileging computational and statistical approaches, databases have also been criticized for further endangering the already threatened taxonomical expertise. To counter this tendency, taxonomers collaborate and experiment with methods to preserve taxonomical knowledge, for instance through initiatives like the _European Distributed Institute of Taxonomy_, but also by engaging in the design and management of data infrastructures. 

Like all sorts of classifications, biological taxonomies are entangled with power: the power to define categories and inclusions and exclusions, as well as the power to enforce these orders. In this sense, **taxonomical orders are never neutral, but have significant real-life consequences**. This is particularly evident in the contemporary articulation of the technocratic governmentality emerging around climate change and the pressing need for quantifying and managing biodiversity loss. If different approaches to taxonomy can result in different interpretations of data, different thresholds, and hence different policies to handle environmental problems, the ordering practices of taxonomy have an important role in how we will manage to navigate the challenges offered by a transforming planet and our [[theme.planetary data]].

<!-- Maybe here we should add something more on the power involved in taxonomical orders... like how they still perpetuate colonial legacies, how they are rarely thought of as political and so on... -->
