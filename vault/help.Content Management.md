## Reviews

1. Authors copy their own markdown texts into a google doc
    - Add images back in from preview "view in browser", if they want.
2. Editors and other authors comment and edit in the google doc (track changes); 1 person takes the lead as primary reviewer per author for a more in-depth comment
    - Webeditor (WE = Therese) does formal edits
        - check markdown and styleguide
        - enter image descriptions
        - show missing 'desc' for summary box
        - add in option for dates at the top
        - check use of backlinks
3. All meet for thorough text workshop
    - start with author talking about some of their intentions, potentially any changes since last discussion, and open questions
    - in depth comment by primary reviewer, shorter comments by the others
    - discussion
4. Authors work in changes
5. Reviewers read and comment on edited texts to give feedback on the changes
6. Authors deliver finalized google docs

## Translations

1. WE does pre-translation check on the finalized google docs
    - check markdown and style guide
    - check footnote style, and edit them to be consecutively numbered
    - check image descriptions
    - check 'desc' for summary box
    - check titles for length and changes
        - if titles changed, potentially change note title in Dendron as well to match
    - check backlinks: 
        - take out backlinks to notes that will not be written
        - change titles of backlinks where the title has changes
    - check attached dates
    - take out any comments to each other
    - add in any necessary comments for the translators
    - send docs to translators in Word

2. WE applies for DOI for each individual text on intranet survey

3. Receive corrected and translated texts
    - WE adds in nec. markdown notation
    - Then send to authors and editors for review and release of the corrected and translated texts

4. WE enters corrected and translated texts into Dendron
    - go via online markdown editor first
    - check preview for any problems
    - check frontend for problems last
        - desktop: check newest version of Safari, Firefox, Chrome
        - mobile: check Android and iOS
    - keep authors out of the texts in dendron, to avoid synchronization problems

5. Send frontend view to authors for final okay

## Editing in the CMS versus Dendron
