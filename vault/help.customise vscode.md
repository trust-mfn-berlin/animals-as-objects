## Changing colour theme

![](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/getstarted/themes/themes_hero.gif)

In VS Code, open the Color Theme picker with File > Preferences > Color Theme. (Code > Preferences > Color Theme on macOS).

You can also use the keyboard shortcut `⌘K` then `⌘T` to display the picker. (On windows `Ctrl+K` then `Ctrl+T`)

Use the `arrow keys` to preview the colors of the theme.
Select the theme you want and press `Enter`.

## Extensions

Much of VSCode can be modified with extensions found in the extension marketplace.

You can see this by going to the Extensions tab. For example, if you wanted to have a different light colour theme for your text editor– you can search 'light theme' and see themes that other people have already made and shared.

## Local editor settings

Other local settings, like font family and font sizes, etc can be accessed by clicking the settings wheel in the bottom left.
