:::EN:::

Text body (up to 500 words) with backlinks like this: [[theme.test]]. The title is already written above.
If needed you can also add footnotes [^footnote1]. The word does not need to be footnote.
As necessary, things can be **bold** or _italic_. 50 - 500 words max.
They can also include:
>Longer quotes from other sources, like this one...

![image description for accessibility](/images/example/hippo.jpg)

_Image caption (less than 200 characters) and source._

If you need to backlink a word that is different from the actual title, use [[themes|templates.theme]].  It should never be a word like "here", used as a hyperlink. It should always be a close variation of the actual title.

If you need to reference another text at the end of a sentence, it looks like this: Here is a sentence, see [[templates.story]].
Hier ist ein Satz, siehe auch [[templates.story]].

## Further stylistic decisions
Dates of life only in material.person, not everywhere

For every document where you care about what's written in it, there should be a material.document

Numbers are written as 165.000 with a dot

Dates in the text are 12 December 1967 in EN, but 12. Dezember 1967 auf DE

Full dates in footnotes are 30.07.1985

Terminology: Zweiter Weltkrieg, Second World War

Use Oxford comma

Use the longer dashes with spaces around it in texts – like this.

<!-- And this allows us to leave notes to the others that are not visible in the preview. -->

[^footnote1]: here REF: Surname, Name. _Book title_. Place: Press, YYYY
Surname, Name. "Article Title." _Journal_ 1, n1 (YYYY): p-pp.
