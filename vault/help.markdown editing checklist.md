Here is what I noted so far, where the postdocs potentially have some inconsistency:

* / in image links `![](/images/cmw/example.jpg)`
* Image treatment joined with captions.
* ^ in Footnotes; just consecutive numbers per word.
* Heading levels in the text (only ## and ###). Space between `#` and Heading text.
* Backlinks (insert title variations where needed)
* `â€¦\*innen` in DE gendered terms
* Splitting :::EN::: :::DE::: correctly
* Cover image in backend
