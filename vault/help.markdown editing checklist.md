Here is what I noted so far, where the postdocs potentially have some inconsistency:

- / in image links `![](/images/cmw/example.jpg)`
- Image treatment joined with captions.
- ^ in Footnotes; consecutive numbers per word
- Heading levels in the text (only ## and ###)
- Backlinks (insert title variations where needed)
- `â€¦\*innen` in DE gendered terms
